Adalab module 3 evaluation: Rick and Morty's character finder.

For this project I had to build a website using React, HTML5 and SASS that allowed the user to find the characters of the TV Show Rick and Morty, filtering the results by name and by vurrent living status. The user had to be able as well of finding more info about the character by clicking into the its card. For the development of this website, I have used this API: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Adalab/rick-y-morty/master/data/rick-y-morty.json
